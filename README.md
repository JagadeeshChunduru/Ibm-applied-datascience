Safe municipal drinking water is important for public health. In this project, municipal water quality data was collected and cleaned to remove missing values, errors, and unnecessary data. After cleaning, Exploratory Data Processing (EDP) was carried out to better understand the water quality parameters. Colorful visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and plots were used to observe patterns, trends, and possible issues in the data. IBM-based data analysis concepts were applied to support the analysis and improve understanding of water safety conditions. This approach helps in identifying water quality variations and supports better decision-making for maintaining safe drinking water in municipalities.
